# RAG from Scratch Implementation

The following notebooks demonstrate the implementation of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture from scratch. Please note that the Python version used in this project is **3.9.1**.

## Notebooks

1. **Document Loading.ipynb** - This notebook handles the loading of documents for the RAG pipeline.
2. **Document Splitting.ipynb** - Demonstrates the process of splitting documents into manageable chunks.
3. **Vectorstores and Embeddings.ipynb** - Implements vector storage and embedding generation for the documents.
4. **Retrieval.ipynb** - Focuses on the retrieval mechanism of the RAG architecture.
5. **Question Answering.ipynb** - Demonstrates the question-answering capabilities of the model.
6. **Chat.ipynb** - Implements a chat interface using the RAG model.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt` and use Python 3.9.1 to ensure compatibility.
